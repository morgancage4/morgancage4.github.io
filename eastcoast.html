        <h2>My East Coast Travels:</h2>
        <p>I have been to 3 states on the East Coast so far; Florida, New Jersey, and New York. 
            Although I am biased in saying I like the West Coast more due to having been around there more and having family in each of those states, I do LOVE the East Coast and cannot wait to visit it more often.
            I for sure want to visit New York again, but definitely want to see the other states as well such as Maine, North Carolina, Massachussets, etc. . 
            I guess technically I have been to North Carolina before, but it was just for a layover on the way to Florida and I did not leave the airport.

            I have been to Florida 3 times in my life. The first time was in 2012 at 9 years old, and the other two were in 2021 at 17 and 18 years old.
            </p>
                <h3>November 2012</h3> 
            <p>
               &nbsp; My first trip to Florida was with Nana. This was our port of departure for the cruise we went on together. We only stayed one night, but still managed to visit the beach and go for a swim at the hotel pool.
            </p> 
                <h3>March & July 2021</h3>
            <p>
                &nbsp;My second and third trip to Florida was during the spring break of my senior year of high school and the summer before I started college. 
                    <br> &nbsp;
                I combine these trips into one entry because both times, I had gone with my best friend Rose, and we stayed in her aunt's guest house.
                It started out as a spur of the moment decision, originally just looking at the price of flights to different parts of the country we knew we had family.
                Most of our high school friends had gone to Mexico for spring break every year, but we didn't have connections on where to stay in Mexico at the time. 
                When looking at Florida, we knew it was a far stretch, but Rose decided to reach out to her aunt to see if we could visit.
                As you can probably guess by this entry, she said YES!
                We immediately booked flights and set off for our first trip.
                We loved loved loved this trip so much that we decided to come back that same July!
                    <br> &nbsp;
                Her aunt had lived in a gated community that had a lake with beach sand and hammocks, a bar, pool, gym, sauna, and more.
                We had spent a lot of our time lounging on the beach, paddle boarding, hanging out at the pool, riding biked that her aunt had loaned us, and working out.
                We utilized the gym and even took a hot yoga class in town together (which we biked really really far to haha). 
                Her aunt had even taken us to the actual beach to go jet skiing and to take a ride on her friends speedboat.
                While on the boat we went fishing and saw dolphins and I believe we saw a manatee (don't quote me on that).
                Overall, these were amazing trips that I will continue to look back on and remember especially when considering spur of the moment trips (which is also what happened for New York lol).

            I have been to New Jersey once, even then it was only where the hotel I was staying at was. Keeping that in mind, I only have one photo of New Jersey - the top right photo. 
            So, enjoy extra pictures from New York in the other photo spots for New Jersey!

                 <h3>January 2025</h3>
             <p>
                &nbsp;My trip to New Jersey is a little underwhelming because I was not in New Jersey for long.
                This is because although I technically stayed in New Jersey, I spent most of my days here actually in New York. 
                    <br> &nbsp;
                While looking for hotels for my New York trip - with my friends Vaikhari and Lana - I decided to look across the Hudson River at hotels in Jersey, or Fairview to be exact.
                These hotels were TREMENDOUSLY cheaper (only $52/night to be exact with my employee discount) and only a half an hour/$4 bus ride (in which the stop was literally right outside our hotel) to Times Square. 
                It was a win-win.
                    <br> &nbsp;
                Although we only spent our nights and early mornings in Jersey, we quite enjoyed it. 
                If we had more time there, I would've loved to check out some of the things around.
                I will say though, January is a rough time to be in New Jersey as someone who grew up in the Phoenix heat.
                It was about 20 degrees when we got in and the wind got up to 63 mph while we were there. 
                Definitely made us second guess if we would survive the next two days fully outside.

                <h3>January 2025</h3>
            <p>
            This was my most recent trip as of making this website (which is why it will be such a big entry, yay!). I went in January of 2025 at 21 years old.
            It was a super spontaneous trip to say the least.
            </p>
            <h4>Planning</h4>
            <p>
            &nbsp;Two of my favorite actors were debuting on Broadway, and it just so happened to be two of my best friend's favorite actors as well.
            Were we both maybe a little crazy with our obsession? Yeah, probably, but it worked out so well.
            Sooooo... I had told Nana (my forever travel buddy) that I would seriously consider going to New York just to see this show on Broadway.
            Funny enough, she shows me this app that tells you the cheapest times to travel to certain cities.
            She gave me the dates, and I RAN with it.
                <br> &nbsp;
            I looked up flights and saw that it was only $227 roundtrip.
            I then decided to look at my employee discount at hotels in the area and found a really decent one for only $52/night in Fairview.
            With these prices, I immediately called up Vaikhari (my best friend) and asked if she was down (we had been discussing this as a joke for weeks at this point).
            Obviously, she said yes and we started thinking of other people we could invite. 
            This is where Lana comes in, she is just as spontaneous as us and we booked our flight, hotel, and tickets to the Broadway show that same night (which happened to be the night before I left on a flight to Oregon with Nana lol).
            We had 3 nights, or 2 total days in New York and we fit as much into that trip as humanly possible.
                <br> 
            </p>
            <h4>The trip</h4>
            <p>
            &nbsp; The <b>first night</b> was rough. We decided to have a relaxing night to prepare for our busy day the following day.
            Immediately after stepping outside from the airport, we were humbled by the cold.
            This only got worse when we decided to walk to the local Chipotle and Target for dinner and to grab some snacks and things we forgot to pack.
            We walked in silence. It was so cold due to a cold front coming in and we were not sure how we were going to survive the following days.
            It fortunately was survivable, but still rough (avg 20-30 degrees and wind up to 63 mph)
                <br> &nbsp; 
            The <b>following day</b>, we were set out on our mission. Luckily the hotel had breakfast included. 
            We started with that and headed to Times Square on the bus.
            We decided to walk around and check out Times Square, then walk from Times Square to The MET through Central Park.
            It was a long and COLD, but enjoyable walk and I'm glad we got to see Central Park, including the start/initial freeze of the ice-skating rink.
            The MET is something I will not forget, I wish we had so much more time there. I could have spent days in The MET alone and plan to visit again someday.
            Following the MET we stopped at local spots for food and took our first Subway down to the library.
            Our subway stop was actually at Grand Central, so we decided to check it out as well as the Chrysler building on the way to the library.
            Unfortunately, right when we got to the library is when they were closing (even though it said it was open for another hour). 
            So, we decided to head to our Broadway show early and check out Rockefeller, St. Peter's Cathedral, Radio City, and the Comcast building on our way since it was all right there.
                <br> &nbsp; 
            Now for the moment we've all been waiting for... the <b>Broadway show, Romeo + Juliet feat. Kit Connor and Rachel Zegler</b>.
            It was life changing, unfortunately. I loved it so much and do not regret spending all of this money to see New York and this show.
            Not only did we sit fourth row, but the theater was interactive (Circle in the Square), we staged door, and we helped Lana win a stuffed bear from the claw machine (which she did in fact get signed by the cast).
            Sadly though, Kit and Rachel did not stage door that night (but did the night before and another favorite actor of ours was in the audience:/).
            The show itself was so amazing AND I was able to follow Shakespearian English. <b> 10/10 Would do again. </b>
            After the show, we checked out Times Square at night then headed back home to get prepare for another busy day.
                <br> &nbsp; 
            Our <b>third day</b> was another big one. We had another continental breakfast before heading to the city to visit the Chelsea Market.
            Lana and I thought we could survive the day without scarves as it was less windy this day (keep in mind I had physically wrapped my face in my scarf the previous day I was so cold).
            We all also decided it should be warm enough to just wear our leather jackets... Yeah that was cut pretty short, and my first purchase was a scarf at the Chelsea market.
            I also tried Indian food for the first time here (with Vaikhari's expert opinion as help ofc). 
                <br> &nbsp;
            Following lunch, we walked along the city skyline overlooking the Little Island.
            We then made our way South to the Statue of Liberty lookout (which not going to lie is very underwhelming if you don't take a ferry... We got a better view from the plane and had a better time on the playground).
            We then made our way through the financial district to get to the Brooklyn Bridge. Saw all the cool buildings like the stock exchange and Trinity Church (which also happened to be closing early right as we walked up for a get this... an Organ tuner... yeah).
            Anyway, we walked through the Financial District to get to the Brooklyn Bridge, in which we only walked up to the first column, but was cool, nonetheless.
            I did almost get hit by a firetruck on the way there though.
            This was the start of the end of our day.
                <br> &nbsp;
            We headed back to the city and sat at a coffee shop waiting to meet up with Lana's friend that lives in Manhattan.
            Her friend, Kevin, took us out to a nice sushi restaurant and out to a local bar that was pretty chill.
            After hitting the bar, Vaikhari and I decided to let them hang out and catch up alone, so we sat and people watched in Times Square and picked up a souvenir before heading back to the hotel.
            Lana on the other hand went to a rooftop bar and did not get home until 6 AM.
            It also snowed overnight, so I am not sure how she survived that or was up and ready to fly back home the next day. 
                <br> &nbsp; 
            Our <b>last day</b> was pretty uneventful since we just went to the airport early and hung out until our 5 PM flight, which had gotten delayed like 3 separate times.
            The flight was great though, pretty empty so I got a whole row to myself (the flight there we were sat in the very back row next to the entirety of GCU men's volleyball team, so big improvement).
            And that was the end to out short, but very eventful trip to New York.
