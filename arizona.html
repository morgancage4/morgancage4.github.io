        <h2>My Travels Around Arizona:</h2>
        <p>Having lived in Arizona, I have travelled around many parts of the state. Some of these cities include
            Peoria (my hometown), Phoenix, Tempe, Sedona, Flagstaff, Winslow, Prescott, Scottsdale, Surprise, and Tucson. 
            Since I have travelled to so many areas, I figured I would just share some of my favorite places and memories.

            I went to college at ASU in Tempe, and I quite enjoyed my time there. 
            Phoenix is also in between Tempe and Peoria, so I have been there many times, especially since it is our capitol and has many events and fun things to do there.
            <h3>Tempe</h3>
                &nbsp;
            fun memories

            I have been to Washington 3 times I believe, but may have forgotten some trips from when I was younger.

            I have been to Sedona so many times to hike and for day trips, just because it is such a beautiful place.
