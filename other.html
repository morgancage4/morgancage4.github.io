            <p>
            I have been to Alaska 3 times in my life. Once, when I was a baby, another as a young child, a third time on a cruise at 19.
            </p>
            <h3>As a baby and as a kid</h3>
            <h4>Anchorage</h4>
            <p>
                &nbsp;
            Although I don't remember going as a little baby, I do slightly remember going in 2009 at the age of 6. 
            I was also obsessed with my cousin Alyssa who lived there and would wish in wishing fountains (and when it was 11:11) to see her again since I didn't see her often. 
            While I was there, we would play all day and I remember that I brought my fake sleeping/breathing puppy toy and took it to the store with us. 
            I specifically remember other customers thinking it was real and feeling so proud, haha. 
            I also remember collecting hermit crabs at the beach in a bucket... sadly they started dying in the bucket and it destroyed 6 year old me. 
            Besides these memories, I honestly don't remember much sadly.
            </p>
            <h3>July 2022</h3>
            <p>
                &nbsp;
            This trip I remember a lot more than the prior two.
                <br> &nbsp;
                Going to Alaska my third time was amazing and I am so glad I remember all of it. 
                I went on an Alaskan cruise with Nana, her sister Leenie, and her sister's kids; Alli and Brady. 
                It was for Alli's graduation with her associates degree and I'm so glad they invited me along.
                <br> &nbsp;
                We left from Seattle and our time on the ship itself was fun. 
                Alli and I decided to go to this 18-20 club the first night where we met around 10 others that we ended up hanging out with most nights.
                On the ship, I also remember going to the shows, to the buffet every morning, to a tea party, and out to dinner every night. 
                I thoroughly enjoyed dinner every night, especially because we had such an amazing and funny server that we loved so much we would request to sit in his section at night (peep his picture off to the side). 
            </p>
                <h4>Ketchikan</h4>
            <p>
                    &nbsp;
                Our first port that we visited was Ketchikan. It was such a beautiful town. 
                We first looked around the port and went over to the spot for our duck boat tour. 
                If you don't know what this is, it is a bus that turns into a boat. It was so so fun and our driver was quite funny. 
                It started off on a tour around the city, followed by a boat ride/tour around the port as well. 
                We were able to see so many beautiful spots, waterfalls, the neighborhoods, and surprisingly lots of bald eagles.
                    <br> &nbsp;
                After out tour we headed back to the port and got donuts at a local shop, I got a cinamon toast cruch one that was SO good. 
                With the time we had left, we walked around the shops and the twon (they had really nice winter jakets for $25  that I still to this day regret I didn't get).
            </p>
                <h4>Juneau</h4>
            <p>
                    &nbsp;
                Our second port was Juneau, it was so so beautiful here and had a huge mountain. 
                We actually ended uo taking the sky tram up the mountain. Up on top there was a lookout, shops, and and eagle that we got to see up close.
                It was raining when we got up there, but it was still so much fun (I also LOVE the rain so I wasn't bothered like some of the other visitors). 
                We then made our way down, checked out the shops, and got back on the boat.
            </p>
                <h4>Skagway</h4>
            <p>
                    &nbsp;
                Our third port was at Skagway, which we had the most time at and it was more of a historical town. 
                We mostly just walked around looking at the plates that shared the histiorical context of different parts of the city. 
                They had an old train we got to climb in as well before we headed over to the Red Onion Saloon. 
                We decided to just eat there, but upstairs they had a brothel museum that you could visit for not too expensive. 
                However, the tours ran every hour and we wanted to make sure we made it to our excursion.
                    <br> &nbsp;
                The excurtion was my FAVORITE part of the trip. 
                It started with us taking a bus up into the mountains where they train SLED DOGS. Yeah you heard me, SLED DOGS! 
                Once we made it to the basic camp, we took a monster truck over to where the dogs train. 
                AND GUESS WHAT?! Me and my cousin Brady got to sit up front with the driver while the other 20ish people who were with us rode in the back. 
                It was so much fun and the roads were so bumpy and insane, it reminded me of going quadding. 
                    <br> &nbsp;
                Now for what we had been waiting for, we got to meet the sled dogs that would be pulling our cart! 
                At first I felt bad for the dogs, but I instantly stopped after seeing them. 
                You could tell how much they just loved to do it - so much so they would start crying, whining, and jumping around in excitement unable to wait for us to get the show on the road. 
                We took a lap around the camp with the dogs pulling us before getting to pet them again.
                    <br> &nbsp;
                We made our way back to the main camp, and on our way we got to check out the lookout over the mountain and it was so beautiful. 
                Back at the camp, we learned about the races the dogs trained for and why they put them in such high elevation, and how they train them and take care of them. 
                    <br> &nbsp;
                Following this lesson we got to meet THE PUPPIES. 
                They were so so so cute and I never wanted to leave. 
                If I could, I would apply to be a trainor/caregiver for the dogs one summer and I definitely considered this. 
                We then headed back and were able to check out the fields at the base of the mountain before heading back to the ship.
                    <br> &nbsp;
                    <br> &nbsp;
                Our final port was in Canada, which I will leave for its own entry on the "Outside the US" page. 
                    <br> &nbsp;
                Overall this trip was so amazing, I would 100% go on another Alaskan cruise even though I have been to all of the ports. 
                I also just wanted to say a huge thank you to Aunt Leenie and Alli for inviting me on this trip and paying for it. 
                I had such an amazing time and really enjoyed getting to spend that time with you.

            I have also been to Colorado twice, both of which were very recent.
            </p>
            <h3>July 2023</h3>
            <p>
                &nbsp;
            The first time I went to Colorado was with my boyfriend and his family to visit and stay at his aunt's house in Fort Collins.
            We flew into the Denver airport together and unfortunately I started the trip with a migraine aura soon after we landed. 
            It was honestly one of the worst migraines I've had and I think it might've been due to the elevation. 
            I had to suffer through this migraine in the car rental place, at a Panda Express, and on the two hour drive to her house. 
            Once we got to the house I went to urgent care with Zane and his dad to get a shot then headed back home. 
            I slept the rest of that day and into the next morning recovering. 
            The rest of the trip went very well though and I am so glad it didn't ruin the whole trip.
                <br> &nbsp;
            The rest of the trip we spent all around Colorado, with some time spent at Aunt Myra's as well. 
            Aunt Myra lived on a lake, so while we were there we went kayaking and canoeing. 
            There was one less seat available between me, Zane, Lij, Lex, and Anjol, so we put a lawn chair in the middle of the canoe that I sat in and got to just sit and enjoy the ride. 
            Outside of that, we also went to the community pool to swim and I went with Lex and Anjol on a walk around the neighborhood and to the local park where they had these swing zip lines that were so much fun. 
            I also spent my time playing cornhole and frisbee outside with Zane. 
            Most mornings or nights we would also enjoy breakfast or dinner out on the patio. 
            We even roasted marshmallows out there one night. 
            One of my favorite things to do at the house was reading on the hammock overlooking the lake. 
            Aunt Myra has the perfect house in such a beautiful location with beautiful art inside as well.
                <br> &nbsp;
            Out on the town, we went to the museum that Aunt Myra works for, the butterfly gardens, walked around and shopped downtown, and also went to a concert in the park. 
            This was one of my favorite memories from this trip. 
            We just brought lawn chairs and enjoyed live music outside and walked around the campus since it was hosted at Colorado State University, who Aunt Myra used to work for (They even had a library named the Morgan library). 
            The downtown was so beautiful, it is full of art (including painted pianos) and flowers everywhere. 
            We also went down while there was a farmers market and I bought a bracelet there. 
            One of the days, we went to a dinner theater and saw The Little Mermaid. 
            It was so, so good, but I also just really love live theater. Our server was one of Ursula's eels. 
            One of the last things we did was visit the flower gardens that the school has.
                <br> &nbsp;
            I really really liked Colorado and visiting is the reason I decided to apply to their dental school. 
            However, I think it will take me a bit to adjust to the elevation.
            </p>
            <h3>September 2024</h3>
            <p>
                &nbsp;
            My second trip to Colorado was to interview at their dental school. I had gone with my boyfriend, his sister, and our friend Danny. 
            We stayed at his aunt's house in Fort Collins this time as well.
            We flew this time as well and I didnt get a migraine, woohoo! 
            However, I did have a mild headache while we were there which was kind of sucky and I think affected my interviews slightly. 
            This time around was a bit chillier since we went later in the year, but we still spent lots of time outside. 
            We went kayaking/canoeing again and I did get to have my own kayak this time. 
            We also spent time just hanging around doing homework and such together. 
                <br> &nbsp;
            This time around, we drove through the mountains, which had such a beautiful view, but made me lightheaded. 
            After, our drive we went downtown, looked at the shops and got ice cream at the Walrus ice cream shop, because you have to no matter the weather. 
            We also checked out the Museum of Discovery, which has a lot of instruments you can play and a rooftop to overlook the city. 
            We spent quite a bit of time here and checked out their dome exhibit and watched a show for a band. 
            It was honestly just trippy visuals that made me feel like I was on shrooms and I could not for the life of me tell how much time had passed. 
            It was quite interesting, but if I were to go again I definitely would check out the space show or one about nature. 
            We also obviously had to go back to the gardens and butterfly exhibit because it's just so pretty. 
            They also had an art show at the gardens and it was fun looking at all the sculptures.
                <br> &nbsp;
            Our last morning was my interview, we drove an hour to get to Aurora for the interview, it was quite a nerve-wrecking drive. 
            I honestly really loved the school. 
            The girl who gave use the tour was actually from ASU and knew some of my friends, it felt really nice. 
            After my interview, we decided to check out the Denver Museum of Nature and Science before heading to the airport. 
            Honestly, we could've stayed quite a bit longer, but it was closing for the day. 
            It had such a beautiful overview of the parks. 
                <br> &nbsp;
            Then we just headed back home (and stopped at Snarf's Sandiwhces at the airport). It honestly felt like such a short trip and I wish we were able to stay a bit longer/didn't have homework, but it was so much fun. 
            I really love Colorado and I'm sure I'll be back to visit again.

            <p>
            I have been to Hawaii only once, and it was as amazing as you would expect.
            </p>
            <h3>June 2019</h3>
            <p>
                &nbsp;
            I stayed on the island, Maui, with Nana and her sister Julie. I was 16 at the time.
            It was as magical as you would expect. 
            We stayed at a hotel walking distance from the beach and would walk down often. 
            They also had a snow cone truck just outside of our hotel that had the best snow cones I have ever tasted in my life (coconut cream on top is the way to go). 
            We spent time swimming at our hotel some, even had a barbeque with a mom and daughter (who was my age) that we met at a Luau. 
            We also spent some nights playing card games, one time with another family whose son I had a crush on at the time (sorry Zane). 
            Obviously, most of our time was spent at the beach and out adventuring.
                <br> &nbsp;
            While at the beaches, we would see so many sea turtles and the water could not be more perfect. 
            I could have stayed in the water all day every day. You could even check out some coral reefs just with a plain scuba mask. 
            One of the days at the beach, Aunt Julie and I even took a surfing lesson that was so much fun.
                <br> &nbsp;
            Besides the beach, we spent time in the town, checking out the aquarium, getting local fruits, having fish tacos, going out to dinner, and going to a luau. 
            The luau was so much fun and I feel like if anyone visits Hawaii, they have to experience/go to at least one luau. 
            Not only was the dinner and pina coladas great, but the show that they had and the community around was so much fun to see. 
            Also, if you look at the photos ffrom the luau, Nana sewed me that outfit, and she sewed me some other clothes for the trip as well (including the set, two tops, a skirt, and a romper)
            Nane, Julie, and I ended one of these nights just sitting and watching the sunset along the cliff, giggling at stupid things we were doing and saying. 
            It was such a peaceful evening. We also got to swim at the luxury hotel pools and walk along the beach that night. 
            I remember just kicking the waves and seeing the stars so clearly that night. 
            I was also talking to someone my age we met at the luau and thinking I will never forget that moment (yes, it was a guy, but it was NOT like that, I actually thought he was kind of annoying and told him later I did not want to hang again lol). 
            It just felt like one of those things youll remember forever, almost like a scene from a movie. 
                <br> &nbsp;
            On one of our last days (possibly our last day) we spent the entire day cruising along and hiking the road to Hana. 
            I am so glad I did not have to drive it, that drive is one of the scariest drives I've experienced since it's on the side of a cliff and there's a lot of one way bridges. 
            However, the hikes and waterfalls were so, so beautiful, even though I did have a fever and started to not feel so great at the end. 
            I am so glad we went and it's another must-do if you ever go to Hawaii.
                <br> &nbsp;
            As expected, Hawaii was one of the best places I have ever been and I will for sure go again, I HAVE to. 
            I remember meeting a flight attendant on the ocean who just spent her time travelling and visiting places like that and I thought, that's what I want to do. 
            However, I have come to realize you do not always get to pick where you are going and the job itself isn't that great. 
            I have come to the conclusion that I will just work to visit the places I want to visit on my own time/with my own money (I really really hope becoming a dentist lets me do that, haha). 
            Overall, a trip that I will remember forever and I feel like could have been a movie with how many things we did and people we met.

            I have been to Nevada twice. One of which was to visit Lake Tahoe (where we were technically switching between California and Nevada, but I am going to 
            put the entry in here to differentiate between my many other California trips) and the other was to tour the dental school in Las Vegas.
            </p>
            <h3>June 2019 (Lake Tahoe)</h3>
            <p>
                    &nbsp;
                The first time I went to Nevada was to go to Lake Tahoe with my Grandma and cousin Brittany soon after my 16th birthday.
                I think majority of the time, we were technically in California, but since I thought this trip was very different from my other California trips, I would put it under Nevada for its own entry.
                    <br> &nbsp;
                When we first arrived, it was time to pick out a rental car. 
                I don't know if you know anything about me, but one of my biggest traits is being indecisive, I am SO horrible at trying to make decisions. 
                However, there is one person who is even worse at making decisions than me and that's my grandma. 
                We originally chose one car, then she decided to go with another. 
                So, we packed our things into the car and started driving away… until she decided she actually wanted the original car. 
                So we drove back and let her contemplate for about 20 minutes before getting into the original car and driving off lol. 
                She also technically had two places to stay for her timeshare, but we mainly only stayed at one. 
                Since it was pretty cold while we were there, we spent a lot of time in the hot tubs and it was known that bears often tried to get into the hot tubs as well. 
                We also spent night and afternoons out by the lake just looking at it. 
                    <br> &nbsp;
                One of the days we walked around the town and went to the pier, this was honestly one of the most naturally beautiful places I have ever been. 
                We spent our days trying fun activities as well. 
                One of the days we went paddleboarding in the FREEZING water. 
                It was so so much fun though. The water there is so clear, we would just spend all of our time paddling to new places and checking out the water underneath. 
                We also decided to do some paddleboard yoga and do some headstands. 
                However, this led to me becoming severely burnt for the rest of the trip.
                    <br> &nbsp;
                Another day, we hiked a mountain to go check out a castle they have near the lake. 
                This was followed by a kayak trip to an island where they had an old building. 
                Grandma was in one kayak while me and Brittany were in another. 
                They had warned us about it being windy on our way back because a storm might be blowing in, but I think we underestimated how windy it would be. 
                Brittany and I could barely move our kayak towards the shore, meanwhile Grandma was already halfway back. 
                She was yelling at us to keep paddling and we were trying so hard. 
                One thing about her is to never underestimate her despite her age. 
                She will out bike and out kayak me any day. 
                We also checked out and got a tour of a historical neighborhood as well, where some of the first settlers lived in and we even saw thier original houses.
                    <br> &nbsp;
                On another particularly nice day, me and my grandma decided to rent electric bikes and go around the town/mountains. 
                This was the most beautiful bike ride I have ever been on, and I biked around the coast in California. 
                We not only biked near the lake, but through big fields that stretched so big and had views of the mountains. 
                I think the weather largely also affected how much I enjoyed this bike ride. 
                It was a good opportunity to spend some time with just us and it was just so beautiful out, it is something I will never ever forget. 
                    <br> &nbsp;
                I hope to also come back here one day and if anyone else ever went, I would tell them to paddleboard and to rent an electric bike. 
                There is so much beautiful scenery here.

                <h3>October 2024 (Las Vegas)</h3>
            <p>
                    &nbsp;
                The second time I went to Nevada, I drove after school with Nana to go tour the UNLV dental school. 
                We decided to make a trip of it and stayed two nights in Las Vegas. 
                The first night we got there, it was pretty late, so we just went straight to bed since the tour of the dental school was the following morning bright and early. 
                    <br> &nbsp;
                The tour of the school itself was fine, but I didn't really like the location, because it felt similar to Arizona, but worse because it was basically just desert right off the strip. 
                It also felt like none of the students wanted to be there, but I felt like I got along really well with the Dean. 
                After the tour, Nana and I got ready and went out to check the Bellagio hotel, where I gambled about $12 before deciding I did not care for gambling lol. 
                We then went to dinner at Dick's (which was inside our hotel), then went over to the New York, New York hotel across the street from us to the Cirque du Soleil Mad Apple show. 
                The show itself was so amazing, it had acrobats, singers, musicians, dancers, comedians, magicians, basically any live entertainment you'd come to Vegas to see. 
                I think with visiting Vegas you have to see some type of show. 
                I also got a frozen alcoholic drink that was pretty good. 
                After the show, we headed back to our hotel and walked around a bit before going to bed. 
                We woke up the next day and just left from there.
                    <br> &nbsp;
                    It was quite a short trip, but I enjoyed it. 
                    I don't know if I really care for Vegas all that much, but the entertainment was great and I'm sure it's fun with a huge group of friends.
