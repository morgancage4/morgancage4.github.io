        <h2>My Travels to Places Outside the U.S. :</h2>
        <p>Outside of the United States, I have been to the Bahamas, Canada, France (Paris), Italy (Amalfi, Rome, Vatican City, Florence, Cinque Terre, and Venice), and Mexico. 
            <br>

            <h2>Bahamas (2012)</h2> 
            <p>
                &nbsp;
            I went to the Bahamas on a cruise with Nana when I was 9 in 2012. 
            We left from Florida and stopped in Jamaica, Mexico, the Cayman Islands, and Great Stirrup Cay. 
            I remember saving up $100 (which took a long time for little me) for an excursion. 
            The excursion was swimming with dolphins. 
            I also remember that I had the choice of going on the cruise that year or waiting another year to go on a Disney cruise. 
            I stuck with the earlier one and we were gone for a week.
                <br> &nbsp;
            During our time on the cruise, I remember swimming at the pool, meeting other kids, getting fancy dinners (I tried lobster for the first time), and going to the shows with Nana. 
            This is where I found out who Franki Valli and the Four Seasons were and I was instantly obsessed (they had impersonators that were so good and had many shows). 
            Once I got home, I even got a CD and I remember listening to it to fall asleep at night. 
            I also remember coming back to our room to find a new towel animal that our maids would leave me every night. 
            I ended up becoming friends with him and was so excited to find new animals. 
            The ship also had rock climbing, a waterslide, and a kids club that I tried. 
            I also had a bunk bed and would switch between the beds every night.
                <br> &nbsp;
            I remember all of the ports we went to as well and I wrote a journal entry every day we were on this trip. 
            The first one we stopped was almost like a private island and we ended up spending most of the time on the beach. 
            At other ports, some felt like a jungle, while others were mostly the beach. 
            During our stops, we went on a guided snorkeling adventure, which was so much fun. 
            It was so cool to see all of the animals underwater, but I still to this day don't understand how snorkels work for going deeper in the water than surface area, haha. 
            We also went ziplining, which I was so proud of Nana for doing. 
            She screamed the whole way down and made sure I knew she was only doing it for me. 
            Another excursion was swimming with dolphins (that I saved for). 
            The dolphins were so cute and I hope they are well taken care of. 
            However, Nana got stung by a jellyfish while we were in the water, which wasn't as fun. 
            We also were able to see exotic birds in the same port. 
            In Jamaica, I remember tumbling on the beach before we hiked up this GIANT waterfall. 
            When I say giant, I mean you could hike a mile up it. 
            It was so beautiful and I don't think I fully understood how special it was at the time. 
            I also got my hair braided here I believe (which I remember being quite painful at the time). 
            However, on our way back to the ship, we ran through a street market to make it to the bus on time, but a woman grabbed my arm which was scary for me, but we were able to leave and get back just in time. 
            Our last port was Mexico, which was a quick stop, so we ended up just walking along the shops before getting back on the boat.
                <br> &nbsp;
            This trip was so much fun and different than any others I had experienced. 
            If you are thinking for a relatively cheap (in comparison to individual flight, hotel, dinner, and entertainment cost) way to travel to many places, a cruise is the way to go. 
            I loved this trip so much and will forever treasure the memories from it.

                &nbsp;
            I went to Canada for less than a day with Nana, Alli, Brady, and Aunt Leenie on our Alaskan cruise. 
            It was our last port as well. 
                <br> &nbsp;
            When we first got off the ship, the first thing we had to do was find a taxi to get to town (we docked in British Columbia). 
            We decided to just taxi to the city center and walk around. 
            We first looked at the capitol building, which was beautiful, and took some photos in front of it and the fountain. 
            Then we checked out this 5 star hotel there and walked around their garden and such. 
            After that, we decided to head to the shops and figure out a place to eat for dinner. 
            We ended up at a nice restaurant for a quick bite to eat before going to a bar across the street since the legal drinking age is 18 there. 
            It was both mine and Alli's first time at a bar (that wasn't also a restaurant lol). 
            We decided to get drinks there before walking around town and heading back to the ship. 
                <br> &nbsp;
            It was a pretty short stop in Canada, but super fun and beautiful nonetheless.

            <h3>Paris</h3>
            <p>
            This was the first stop on mine and Nana's 3-week trip to Europe. 
            Arriving there felt like a dream, it almost felt like we were on another planet. 
            We first took a train to the closest stop by our hotel, then walked the rest of the way to our hotel (about a mile) on the cobblestone. 
            It was a rough walk with the suitcases, but I also didn't care because everywhere you looked had historical buildings, churches, and beautiful views. 
            Just walking by people sitting at the cafes felt so surreal. 
            Our hotel itself was really nice as well and we had a patio that overlooked some of the city. 
            I also learned here that a lot of European showers don't have doors or curtains/are just open and some don't even have a holder for the shower head. 
            It was really interesting to try and figure out and it's safe to say I soaked the bathroom. 
            I know the general rule is to not sleep when you get somewhere to avoid jet lag, but Nana and I could not resist and we took a short nap. 
            After our nap, we checked out some of the city and made our way to the Eiffel tower. 
            We decided we would be taking the subway and figuring it out as we went, but we wanted to make sure we were doing it right the first time. 
            We ended up going to one of the workers and asking for help and she ended up helping us plan our entire trip there. 
            She took us through each of our days/schedules and told us which subways and trains we would need to take each day and where to get off and on. 
            There is this general stigma that Parisians are very rude people, but we felt quite the opposite (there was one instance we would agree). 
            Even on the trains, there were people playing the accordion and sang.
            After planning it out, we went to the Eiffel tower and ended up getting dinner at a spot nearby. 
            We even ran into a couple who had just got engaged and they asked us to take their picture in front of it. 
            We also walked around the park around the Eiffel tower for a bit, it was beautiful. 
            Although that night, we didn't keep all of our tickets for the train after swiping them in and we got stopped and had to pay $100 for not keeping both (I gave them every other validated ticket I had including one of the ones that was active, they threatened the police and DID NOT CARE, KEEP ALL YOUR TICKETS ON YOU EVEN ON THE TRAIN).
            The food here was so amazing though. Each night we had something great, even a little hole in the wall in an alley had the best pasta I have ever had. 
            In the mornings, we would also stop at the bakery just across the street from our hotel to get pastries or whatever we wanted for breakfast and it was always SO amazing and less than $5.
                <br> &nbsp;
            The following day, we stopped at the Pantheon, then headed over to the Louvre. 
            I could have spent a week at the Louvre alone, it is SO massive and I was blown away at literally every single room we stepped in. 
            The crown jewels room is one you cannot miss if you ever go, and Nana and I almost skipped it. 
            The architecture and building itself is impressive on its own with painted ceilings and walls and carved marbles all around. 
            I will say, the Mona Lisa is so underwhelming it made me laugh in person. 
            It is so small in person and it's in a room with another painting that takes up a whole wall meanwhile like 80 people are lined up to see the Mona Lisa up close. 
            We did not wait in that line lol and just saw it from a distance. 
            After the Louvre, we headed to St. Chapelle, which has the most beautiful stained glass and was just next to the Palais de Justice and just a short walk over to Notre Dame. 
            After that, we got dinner and headed back home.
                <br> &nbsp;
            Our last full day, we went over to the opera house first, which was honestly the most beautiful buildings I have ever been in and I will never forget it. 
            I was just in constant awe of the architecture and magical feeling of it. 
            I highly recommend stopping there just to take a look inside. 
            After, we headed over to the Versailles palace, which was a farther commute, but so worth it. 
            We got to walk around the majority of the palace and I just can't believe people actually used to live in places like this. 
            If you go, you CANNOT skip the gardens. Nana and I almost did cause it was an additional charge, but DO NOT skip it. 
            You could literally stay in the gardens a full day. 
            They have a lake, multiple mazes, restaurants, parks, water fixtures/fountains (like MASSIVE with water shows), statues all around, actual gardens, other separate buildings (like ballrooms). 
            I honestly wish we had more time than we did to explore it. 
                <br> &nbsp;
            The next morning we took the train over to the airport to fly to Amalfi next.

            <p>
                Just wanted to say how pretty Italy was overall.
                Even the train rides between cities had me turning my phone off to just look at the scenery outside. 
                I want to go back to visit more cities there.
            </p>
            <h3>Amalfi/Sorrento/Maiori/Positano</h3>
            <p>
                &nbsp;
            This was the second spot on our trip and it was also amazing, but had some rocky moments lol. 
            When we first arrived at the airport, we took a cab to our hotel (which ended up being $100) even though it was not that far. 
            The bed and breakfast itself was on the side of a cliff and had quite a bit of stairs to get up. 
            It used to be a Montesorri and the hallway was made out of the cliff like a cave. 
            It was the coolest place we stayed at for sure. 
            Our room also had a window overlooking the coast and the balcony up top (where they had complimentary breakfast) also had a bar, overlooked the coast, and was covered on the sides and roofed by a cave. 
            We had also met so many fun people we hung out with during our time here. 
            During the days, you only had 3 options of when to bus down and back from the beach/port because it wasn't walkable (the streets had no sidewalks and it was a very long way down), which made things a bit tricky for us. 
            We headed down to the port our first night and got pizza and an aperol spritz and hung out at the park and checked out the beach. 
                <br> &nbsp;
            The following days were spent down at the beach and visiting other ports through the water taxis. 
            However, we would spend the nights/afternoons at our port getting diner and such. 
            We even got dinner at the hotel owner's cousin's place, which had the best bruschetta I've ever tasted (and I don't even like tomatoes usually). 
            We had originally gotten a bus ticket, but the buses did not stop to pick up ANYONE. 
            We waited for the bus numerous times with big groups of people too and they just genuinely do not care. 
            If you go DO NOT plan to use the buses and just get a water taxi or unfortunately another expensive cab. However, I will say the water taxis are quite fun and you get a view of the coastline from the water. 
                <br> &nbsp;
            The other ports were also so beautiful and we spent majority of our time walking the streets, looking at the shops (yes we hiked up to CB Positano, but I didn't end up getting anything). 
            The streets themselves were also beautiful and there's a lot of lemon everything here. We obviously also stopped to get lemon sorbet in a giant lemon, which was great as expected. 
                <br> &nbsp;
            One of the days we were out, we were supposed to go on a yacht with free drinks and food, for a tour around the coast to beautiful spots and to snorkel, but knowing my luck, it unfortunately rained that day. 
            We had already taken a water taxi to the port we were supposed to leave from when it was cancelled. 
            All of the locals were also talking about how it never rains there, especially during that time of year, which did not help AT ALL. 
            We decided to stop at a restaurant that had some covering outside to get some drinks just to get out of the rain while we decided what to do next. 
            All of the water taxis for the rest of the day were cancelled and we were already overhearing from people that the buses weren't stopping either. 
            We ended up having to take another $100 taxi to go like 3-5 miles back to our port. 
            We spent that night on our balcony with the other women that were staying there, using the bar and trying the limoncello the others bought. 
            It's safe to say I will never drink limoncello again, haha (especially after a particularly long and rocky water taxi ride the next day). 
            Again, we met so many great people, including an Australian couple, a British mom and daughter, and a group of moms and daughters that we hung out with while here. 
                <br> &nbsp;
            Overall, great time here and I loved that we got a more "beachy" stop on our big trip.
            </p>
            <h3>Rome (& the Vatican)</h3>
            <p>
                &nbsp;
            Rome was our third spot on our European trip. 
            I loved this spot, but also unfortunately got two migraines while here I think because of the humidity and the hotel was having issues with the A/C. 
            I also had a rough day travelling to Rome because we travelled on my birthday, it was so hot, we almost missed our train, and we had to climb MULTIPLE flights of stairs and I carried both of our suitcases (a combined 90 lbs). 
            Once, we got there we were mostly good, but still had a few mishaps. 
            This included not being able to find a place to eat dinner on my birthday for like a solid hour of walking around (the local we spoke to said the restaurants in that part of town had the authentic good food, but most had hours worth of line/nor reservations or reservations only). 
            One huge pro was that our hotel was actually 20 feet from the Trevi Fountain and we would see it every time we would leave. 
            The hotel was even named after the fountain because it was just that close. 
            While here, we saw the Trevi Fountain, the Altar of the Fatherland, the Roman Forum, and the Colosseum. 
            I remember the Forum had a building named Vesta, which is my great grandma's (Nana's mom's) name. 
            They also had water from a well that was so nice in the humidity. 
            We also spent our time there speaking to locals, laughing at all of the tiny cars, and taking in the views. 
                <br> &nbsp;
            One of the afternoons we went to the Vatican, which was so beautiful, but I got a migraine aura half way through and could not see for the rest of the tour and there were no exits. 
            Once we got out we immediately stopped at the Vatican McDonalds to try and get a quick bite to eat and water to help. 
                <br> &nbsp;
            Our last night, we went to the Spanish steps and overlooked the city. 
            It was really nice to take moments like these to just soak it all in. 
                <br> &nbsp;
            We also unfortunately had to leave Rome a day early to go to Florence because the train workers were having a strike and would not be running trains the day we were supposed to travel. 
            However, I think we still made the most of Rome. 
            </p>
            <h3>Florence</h3>
            <p>
                &nbsp;
            Florence was also another great stop on our Europe trip. 
            It was our fourth stop and we arrived a day early due to the protests of the train workers. 
            We walked once again (and broke suitcase wheels) along the cobblestone streets to our first hotel. 
            Although these walks kind of sucked with suitcases, I always enjoyed doing it to get to see the city on our way to our hotel. 
            The first hotel we stayed at was literally like 25 feet from the Piazza del Duomo. 
            Our room also had a shared terrace that we kept the doors open to while it rained. 
            We got there before check in so we decided to take a walk around the city before taking a nap when we could actually check in. 
            We also got dinner at a nearby restaurant and this is probably where the food was the best in Italy (we honestly enjoyed Paris' food the best). 
                <br> &nbsp;
            The following day we transferred over to our new hotel that was along the Arno river.
            While in Florence, I ended up getting a migraine one day as well and we took it easy up until our pasta making class. 
            This was honestly one of our best meals and we even got chocolate salami for dessert with the recipe (YOU HAVE TO TRY IT). 
            It was so good. 
            Most nights, we also stopped at the infamous Gelateria La Carraia. 
            We also went to the Uffizi Gallery, the Galleria dell'Accademia di Firenze (where the statue of David is), and the Medici palace. 
            The rest of the time we spent walking the city and lots along the river. 
            We even spotted that guy who's known for singing on one of the bridges.                
            </p>
            <h3>Cinque Terre</h3>
            <p>
                &nbsp;
            We decided to do a guided tour here that left from Florence. 
            We walked a (LONG) ways to the bus pickup spot, where it would drive us to the first train station that goes through Cinque Terre. 
            The drive itself was about an hour or two. We got to spend a bit of time at four of the five “Terre”s for a short period before stopping at the next. 
            The last port, we took a boat to. 
            It was definitely a beautiful place, but I wish we were able to spend less time travelling, and instead pick our favorite ones to spend more time at swimming and such. 
            I definitely had favorite ports, but they were also very different from one another. At one of the ports, we had included lunch that Nana HATED. 
            It included a seafood salad then pesto pasta. When I say seafood pasta, it was quite literally just a mixture of different sea creatures on one plate. 
            I still tried it though and it wasn't too bad. We were also able to take some time to swim at two of the spots. 
            The others, we would walk the shops/towns and/or sit by the water. 
            I enjoyed it here, but the amount of walking and moving made us so tired by the time we got back to Florence.
            </p>
            <h3>Venice</h3>
            <p>
                &nbsp;
            This was our final stop on our European trip. 
            We were pooped at this point and had more of a relaxing time here, but still filled it with lots to do. 
            Getting there was a little tricky since there's no cars, so when we landed at the airport we took a boat closer to our hotel where we lugged suitcases through the streets and over stair bridges to our hotel. 
            The hotel itself was nice, our room was entirely pink. 
            Pink carpet, pink walls, pink bedding, pink chairs… you get the point. 
            We spent a lot of time just walking around Venice taking in the scenery.
                <br> &nbsp;
            Our scheduled itinerary included Doge's Palace, the Museo di San Marco, and the Basilica of St. Mark. 
            They were all so beautiful and we walked through St. Marks Square every day. 
            We also obviously had to take a gondola ride (a must in Venice) and it was so, so nice. 
            We also walked over to where they filmed My Policeman so I could get a picture in front of the artwork there. 
            Outside of our itinerary we spent time shopping (they have SO many cute shops, especially bookstores/costume shops), walking along the coast, checking out churches, and even sitting at a park and garden. 
            I feel like the park/garden was such a hidden treasure no one mentions when traveling there. 
            We spent time just relaxing and people watching/taking in the views at the parks on the West end and I would HIGHLY recommend if you have down time.
                <br> &nbsp;
            Now food on the other hand, that's a whole other story. 
            I'm not going to lie, we were quite disappointed with the majority of the food selection here. 
            We tried places that had some decent food, but quite expensive, and we even tried a place the hotel staff recommended. 
            My pasta came out not fully cooked and hard and Nana's onion soup was literally just pureed white onion with melted cheese on top. 
            I'm not even exaggerating, I put in a picture so you could all see how bad it was. We then decided to eat at the HardRock Cafe… twice. 
            I know, I know, this is not something you should admit, especially to Italians, but we were craving/missing American food after 3 weeks. 
                <br> &nbsp;
            Overall, Venice was an amazing experience. 
            I am so glad I got to see it and really enjoyed just walking around through the alleys. 
            You can even go into some tunnels as well. 
            We also took a private speedboat over to the airport that picked us up from the hotel. 
            There is literally a drive up dock on the other side of the lobby, so we got into the boat from the lobby. 
            This was so much fun and felt so fancy. It was also so convenient. 
                <br> &nbsp;
            That was the conclusion of our Europe trip and it was really nice to have a more relaxing city to finish it out.

            I have been to Mexico 4 times, the first time on the cruise with Nana (documented under Bahamas since it was one port), two times with friends and a fourth time for a mission trip. 
            The two times with friends were with the same people (one person joined the second year) so I will combine those into one entry.

            <h3>June 2022 & June 2023</h3>
            <p>
                &nbsp;
            This trip is in majority thanks to my friend Gavin, whose parents have a timeshare here as well as one of their bosses, who kindly let us stay in theirs for a pretty decent price once split between us. 
            The first trip included Zane, Gavin, Katlin, Danny, and I (with Ayden joining in on the second trip). 
            Gavin's parents and a few of their friends came as well.  	
                <br> &nbsp;
            Majority of these trips were spent swimming in the ocean (which had jellyfish both times as well as stingrays), swimming at the pool, at the bars, and hanging out together. 
            We also went to Wrecked at the Reef both times and I would highly recommend their scooby shot. 
            We went to Thrifty's, did karaoke, got churros and tacos at local stands. 
                <br> &nbsp;
            The first time we went, we also tried the banana boats. 
            These were literally so insane and hard to hold on to, I actually only fell once (because I thought we were done, but they started back up after I let go). 
            It hurt to stay holding on and we would all slide around the raft struggling to get back in our seats. 
            This was so much fun though and had us all laughing. 
            I would highly recommend them (although Zane would say otherwise).

            <h3>July 2023 (Mission Trip)</h3>
            <p>
                &nbsp;
            This was a five day (4 night) trip to Puerto Penasco with the R.I.C.E. Clinic, ASU pre-dental club, and a bunch of dental students. 
            Majority of the people going, headed up in a giant van, but since I found out about it and decided to go the night before, I drove up with the main dentist's friend, Myron. 
            It was actually pretty enjoyable and we had very interesting and funny conversations. 
                <br> &nbsp;
            While there, we stayed in a giant mansion - two to a room and I was actually able to stay in the master bedroom with another girl since there were only 6 girls (out of like 20 of us). 
            The first night we just headed to a place next door to the church we were using for the clinic (after set up) for dinner and went to bed early for the clinic the following day. 
            One of the nights, we went to town to get fish tacos along the beach. 
            I think I unfortunately got food poisoning from this, not many others did though and I think I got the worst of it… 
            I had to suffer through it the rest of the days, but still assisted and was in the clinic for all of the days. 
            We had 2 10 hour days and an 8ish hour day on our final day of the clinic and helped over 300 individuals. 
            It was so tiring, but very worth it. 
                <br> &nbsp;
            Outside of the clinic, some people went swimming, but lots of students were studying for the DAT. 
            Majority of us just hung around and one of the nights, we had a nice dinner and ceremony where everyone was given a certificate by the rotary club for our work there. 
            Our last night was spent going to the town and me and a few others just walked along the beach and used the swings there. 
            I ended up actually leaving a day earlier than everyone else with Myron because the plan was just to hang out and I didn't really care to. 
                <br> &nbsp;
            Overall, fun but tiring trip and I am glad I went out of my comfort zone and decided to do this trip without knowing anyone prior.
