        <h2>About Me & This Site:</h2>
        <p>Hi I'm Morgan Cage and I created this site as a digital diary of all of my travels. <br>
            I travel quite often with friends and family and thought it would be a good idea to keep memories of these trips.
            I have these organized by location as seen by the navigation links and each of these are further divided into either the cities, states, or countries I have visited in each of these areas.
            Feel free to give me feedback on what I can improve, where and who I should travel with next, and favorite trip and/or memory using the survey link at the bottom of the page.
            You can also reach out through email by clicking on my email address, which is down below as well.
            I hope you enjoy, get inspiration for your next travels, or get some reminders of the trips you have shared with me/had on your own!
            <br>
            <br>
